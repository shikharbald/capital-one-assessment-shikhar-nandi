REQUIRES Python 3.7 or later to run. 

This is my solution to the Capital One Assessment 2021 New graduate Software Engineer

This zipfile contains folder: Capital_One_Assessment_by_Shikhar_Nandi
 and within that file it contains Assignment, documentation.docx, documentation.pdf, and a README.md file.

The assignment folder contains 5 files: 

main.py 
modules
    extractinfo.py
    extractinfo_2.py
    extensiontype.py
syntax.json


BRIEF SUMMARY: 

Two solutions were made for this assignment. The extractinfo.py is the main solution, 
for extraction whereas the extractinfo_2.py  is an approach using a different technique. 
To try the other approach, in the main.py simply change from modules.extractinfo import ExtractInfo
to from modules.extractinfo_2 import ExtractInfo in line 9.

To run either simply follow the instructions below.


1) Open your command line
2) cd into the Assignment folder
3) type: python main.py [path-to-file-that-you-want-to-parse], example: python main.py ./tests/java_test.java
(if this doesn't work try python3 main.py [path-to-file-that-you-want-to-parse]), as your computer may configure python 3.7 to that command.
4) Output will be displayed on the command line

Some tests are provided in the tests folder.
